This directory contains the source of the TOTP (RFC6238) algorithm
implemented in ECMAScript (ECMA262).

TOTP stands for "Time-based One-Time Password" which is an algorithm
that extends the One-Time Password (OTP) algorithm, namely the HMAC-
based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm (RFC4226) to support the
time-based moving factor.
